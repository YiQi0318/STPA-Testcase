Test Scenario:
Scenery: - S1: Busy cityscape with high vehicular traffic. The safety driver is navigating through a complex traffic environment such as a crowded intersection or a busy highway. Suddenly, the vehicle in front comes to an abrupt stop. Due to being distracted by a mobile device, the safety driver is late in providing the Brake-by-Wire (BBW) command, leading to a potential accident. This scenario can be simulated on the CARLA simulator maps: Town03 and Town10, which offer complex urban
Environment: Sure, here are the environment details for the given scenario under various weather and visibility conditions:

Test Scenario 1:
- Weather: Clear, sunny
- Visibility: High, no obstructions (ClearNoon)

Test Scenario 2:
- Weather: Wet, cloudy
- Visibility: Moderate, potential for glare from wet surfaces (WetCloudyNoon)

Test Scenario 3:
- Weather: Clear
- Visibility: Low, due to setting sun (ClearSunset)

Test Scenario
Dynamic elements: Test Scenario:

- DE1: Safety Driver (The Safety Driver in the CARLA simulator is the controller who is supposed to provide the control action. In this scenario, the safety driver is distracted by a mobile device.)

- DE2: Brake-by-Wire (BBW) System (The controlled part is the Brake-by-Wire system. In the CARLA simulator, the BBW system can be programmed to react according to the safety driver's control.)

- DE3: Vehicle in Front (
Context: Test Scenario:

- TS1: The Safety Driver is in the vehicle, controlling the Brake-by-Wire (BBW) system. The Safety Driver is distracted by a mobile device, indicating a potential risk.

- TS2: The vehicle is on a road with various static and dynamic obstacles positioned around. These could include other vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, etc. This adds an element of unpredictability to the scenario.

- TS3: The vehicle in front of the Safety Driver's vehicle suddenly
Pass criteria: Pass Criteria for a Test Scenario:

1. What could trigger the incorrect decisions of CA?
   - The test scenario passes if the Safety Driver's distraction due to a mobile device triggers the incorrect decision of providing Brake-by-Wire (BBW) when the vehicle in front suddenly stops. This means that the safety driver should be unable to provide the correct brake response due to the distraction.

2. How could correct decisions on CA become unsafe?
   - The test scenario passes if even correct decisions on Brake-by-Wire (BBW) provision by the Safety Driver become unsafe due to external factors. This could be the sudden stop of the vehicle in front, causing a potential collision despite the correct brake response.

In summary, the pass criteria for this test
