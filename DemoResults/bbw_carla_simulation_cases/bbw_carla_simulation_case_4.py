This script connects to the CARLA server, loads the map 'Town01', sets up the environment with conditions like 'ClearNoon', and spawns a vehicle and a camera sensor. It then listens for images from the camera sensor, processes each image, and evaluates it according to the pass criteria. Finally, it cleans up by destroying all actors at the end of the simulation.
