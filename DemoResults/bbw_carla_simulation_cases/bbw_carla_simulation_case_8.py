This script connects to a CARLA server, loads a map, sets up the environment, spawns a vehicle, attaches a camera sensor to it, processes the images captured by the sensor, and finally destroys all actors (vehicles, sensors, etc.) at the end of the simulation. The pass criteria evaluation function is not included as it is not specified in the test case.
