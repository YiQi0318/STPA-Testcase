Sure, here's a Python script that meets your requirements. Since the test case doesn't specify any dynamic elements, sensors, or pass criteria, the script simply connects to the CARLA server, loads the specified map, sets the weather, and then cleans up.

```python
import carla
import random
import time
import numpy as np
import cv2

def main():
    client = None
    world = None
    try:
        # Connect to the CARLA server
        client = carla.Client('localhost', 2000)
        client.set_timeout(2.0)

        # Load the specific map
        world = client.load_world('Town01')

        # Set up the environment
        weather = carla.WeatherParameters.ClearNoon
        world.set_weather(weather)

        # Since no specific dynamic elements or sensors are specified, we don't spawn any

        # Similarly, since no pass criteria is specified, we don't implement any image processing function

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception caught: {e}")
    finally:
        # Ensure proper cleanup
        if world is not None:
            actors = world.get_actors().filter('*')
            for actor in actors:
                actor.destroy()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is very simple and doesn't do much, as it's based on the very limited test case you provided. CARLA simulations can be much more complex, with vehicles, pedestrians, and other dynamic elements, different sensors attached to the vehicles, complex pass criteria, and more. If you provide more details in your test case, I can generate a more complex and interesting script.
