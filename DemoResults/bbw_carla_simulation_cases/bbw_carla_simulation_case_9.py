This script connects to the CARLA server, loads the Town01 map, sets the weather to ClearNoon, spawns a random vehicle at a random location, attaches a camera sensor to it, and processes the images captured by the camera. After 20 seconds, it destroys all the actors and closes the image display window. Please note that the pass criteria evaluation function and specific dynamic elements or sensor behavior are not implemented in this script as they were not specified in the task.
