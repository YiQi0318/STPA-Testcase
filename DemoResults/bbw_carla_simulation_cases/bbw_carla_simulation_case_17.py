This script connects to a CARLA server, loads a specific map, sets up the environment, spawns a vehicle and a camera sensor, runs the simulation for a while, and then destroys all actors. The image processing function just displays the images received from the camera. The specific logic for the pass criteria and the dynamic elements behavior is not implemented because it's not specified in the test case.
