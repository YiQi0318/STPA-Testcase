This script connects to the CARLA server, loads the Town01 map, sets the weather to ClearNoon, spawns a random vehicle, runs the simulation for a while, and then destroys all actors. It does not spawn or attach any specific sensors or dynamic elements, nor does it implement any specific image processing or pass criteria evaluation functions, as these are not specified in the scenario.
