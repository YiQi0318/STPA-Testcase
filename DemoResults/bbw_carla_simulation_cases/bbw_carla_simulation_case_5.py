This script connects to the CARLA server, loads the map `Town01`, sets up the environment with `ClearNoon` conditions, spawns a vehicle, attaches an RGB camera sensor to it, and sets up an image processing function that currently only displays the images. The script then runs the simulation for a while before cleaning up by destroying the vehicle and the sensor and closing the image display window. 

Please note that the image processing function does not currently implement any object detection or classification logic, as this would require a more complex implementation involving machine learning algorithms, which is beyond the scope of this script. However, you can add your own logic to this function as indicated by the comment in the code.
