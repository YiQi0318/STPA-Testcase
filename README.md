Ensuring system-level safety in Artificial Intelligent (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) applications, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation systems, is a critical challenge. 
While Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) provides a robust framework for identifying hazards and unsafe control actions, its potential for guiding test scenario generation in Learning-Enabled Systems (LESs) has not been fully explored. Traditional approaches to test scenario generation in LESs are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this, our paper introduces an automated framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test scenarios based on STPA analysis at the design stage of LESs. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through a detailed case study on a real-world LES, demonstrating significant improvements in the efficiency and coverage of test scenarios generation compared to traditional methods.

### Highlight

1. The research introduces a framework that, during the design stage, uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test scenarios for Learning-Enabled Systems (LESs).
2. The LLM-driven approach improves the efficiency and comprehensiveness of safety analysis, and offer broader coverage of potential hazards, as compared to traditional methods.
